# Automated Transportation Information Scraper

In this project, I scraped the departure and arrival times for subway in Izmir, a city in Turkey. 

First, the program scrapes the station names from the website, asks for the user's departure and arrival station names, and does input validation.

After receiving the station names, the program enters them on the website, scrapes the arrival and departure times, and returns them to the user.
